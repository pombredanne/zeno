Zeno is a Java Web application.

Prerequisites

1. A runtime environment for Java (JDK 1.3 or later)
2. An installation of the MySQL database system.  (See http://www.mysql.org)
3. A container for Java servlets.  The Open Source Tomcat system, available
at http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html, is recommended.

To install Zeno:

1. Put the zeno.war file into the folder for web applications (default name: webbapps) 
of your servlet container.

2. Start the servlet runner, to let it unpack and configure the web application 
in the appropriate way.

3. Stop the servlet runner, if does not terminate with an error message by itself. 
The Zeno is not yet able to run, because the zeno configuration file is 
incomplete and the database has yet to be initialized.

4. Configure Zeno by editing <webapps>/zeno/WEB-INF/conf/zeno.properties

5. Creating the database

Use the mysqladmin command line tool to define the <dbName> database, where
<dbName> is the name you provided for the database in the zeno.properties file
in step 4 above.

> mysqladmin --user=<dbUserName> -p create <dbName>

use the mysql client command line tool to define and initialize the database

> mysql
 > use <dbName>
 > source ./zeno/WEB-INF/conf/zeno.sql
 > grant all on *.* to <dbUserName>@"%" identified by '<dbPassword>'
 > quit

This will create the initial zeno superuser:

	username: admin; password: admin
	
6. Start the servlet container again.  You may now login, using the
admin account, to create journals and register users.  You should probably
change the password of the admin account.  If you do, you also need to manually
change the password in the <webapps>/zeno/WEB-INF/conf/zeno.properties file
before restarting the Zeno server.
