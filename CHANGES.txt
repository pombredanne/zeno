Version 2.0.2

1. The communities concept has been implemented. Each group is registered in just
one community. Each user may be registered in more than one community.
The ZENO superuser "zenoadmin" is "superadministrator" for principals.
He may register additional superadministrators. Superadministrators may create
communities and appoint administrators for  those communities.
Administrators may register users, groups and collectives in their community.

2.  Article may be sent to a section (i.e. journal) via email.
To enable this feature:
-  the Jakarta-James mailer (application!) has to be installed on the server.
-  the special user "mailer" must be made a moderator of this section
-  the section "mailalias" attribute of the secition must given a unique (ZENO wide!)
alias, to be used in email addresses.
For example, if the alias is "test" and Zeno is installed on the server with the
domain name "zeno8.gmd.de", an email can be sent to the section using the
email address "test@zeno8.gmd.de".   In this first version of the email
interface, mails are added to the section as "free" articles, not topics or part
of a topic.  Mails may contain attachments, but the total size of a mail, i
ncluding all attachments, may not excede 8 MB.

3.  Many bugs have been fixed.   See:

	http://zeno8.gmd.de/zeno/forum?action=editJournal&id=8018&view=search

4. Each section can have its own style sheets.  Currently, you may choose from
two style sheets:
- the standard Zeno style sheet
- a minimal style (named "no style sheet")
Please, send additional style sheets to  Lothar Oppor (lothar.oppor@ais.fhg.de) to
be considered for adding the standard library of stylesheets distributed with Zeno.

5. Topics (actual view, structure view, search view and trash view) are
available

6. According to 1. an extension of the database is required. The definition of
the database can be found in
	 ./conf/zeno.sql.
Some changes in the database table entries are required:
- The principal guest's class has to changed from "person" to "collective"
- The principal any's class has to changed from "person" to "community"
- the table community_member has to be filled.
- the table plugin has to be created.
- in the table article a new column "nr" has to be created and filled.
*** Recommended is the use of the new administrator tool "Upgrade".
